    "Now that we have two aggregated dataframes for Comments and Answers that map to a Question, our final statistical challenge is to merge these two dataframes, combine the scores and find the questions with the highest aggregate scores overall. Note that there are two key problems to overcome, firstly one dataframe uses the column header 'ParentId' while the other uses 'PostId'. So we should rename 'ParentId' to 'PostId' in the Answers dataframe. The second problem is that both dataframes have the column 'Score'. But we can't have two columns in a single dataframe with the same key. So we should rename them to 'Answers-Score' and 'Comments-Score'. Once this is done, we can merge the two datafraes by PostId and create a new column called 'Total-Score' which contains the sum of the other two Score Columns. Once we have everything in place, we can sort based on Total-Score, and write out our new dataframe, along with a dump of the PostIds and Total Scores to a text file for a sanity check."
